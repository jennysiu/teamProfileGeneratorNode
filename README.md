## Description

The Team Profile Generator is a Node.js command-line application designed to help managers and team leads quickly generate a webpage that displays the essential information of their software engineering team members. By collecting information about employees through a user-friendly command-line interface, the application outputs an HTML webpage showcasing summaries for each team member, including their names, email addresses, and GitHub profiles. This tool aims to facilitate access to team members' contact information and professional profiles, streamlining communication and collaboration within teams.


## Features
